# Gitcy

A small python package for some github cli utilities.
Is it necessary? No.
Is it helpful? Maybe.
Does it feel better? Yes.

## Why

Instead of writing

```shell
git commit -m "Title \n\nMore Description"
git push
```

you can directly type

```shell
ctd -t "Title" -d "More Description" -p
```
